**Information architecture:**

Dobble is a well-known card game where players aim to spot matching images on two cards. I've revamped it to resemble a kind of arcade game. My adaptation launches instantly and maintains an endless flow of action. Time measurement intensifies the pressure and heightens the intensity. The game is endless and the score may fluctuate between positive and negative.

**Design:**

The typography echoes the classic look of arcade machines. Retro icons also introduce a nostalgic touch. This vintage charm contrasts with a modern-toned background.
